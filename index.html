  <p>Dear Eli,</p>
  <p>Happy Birthday! You're the best brother I could hope for. You're so smart, kind, considerate, athletic, and funny. I always enjoy everything I do with you, such as playing basketball, playing video games, and more! I'm so glad you are my brother and I wish the best for you in life. I love you so much. Have a great birthday!</p>
  <p>Love,</p>
  <p>Isaac</p>
