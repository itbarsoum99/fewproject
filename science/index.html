        <h2>Being LGBTQ+ is Not a Choice</h2>
        <p>A frequent misunderstanding concerning the LGBTQ+ community is the idea that being gay, or being trans, etc. is a choice. This is simply untrue. Sexual orientation and gender identity that differ from heteronormativity and assigned gender norms is not something people choose to be. It's not a lifestyle, either: a lifestyle would be something like <i>vegetarianism</i> or <i>nomadism</i>. A lifestyle is something you choose to be, something you choose to practice. The romantic or sexual attraction to someone of the same gender, or the aversion to associating with your assigned gender, is something biological, in the same way that heterosexuality (the attraction to individuals of the opposite gender) is biological. Don't believe us? A <a href="https://time.com/3733480/ben-carson-gay-choice-science/">study</a> by neuroscientist Simon LeVay in 1991 showed that a region in the hypothalamus related to homosexuality known as INAH3 is smaller in gay men and women than it is in straight men. Additional studies have shown that another brain region and/or genetics could be related to homosexuality.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is even more evident that being transgender is caused by a condition. <i>Gender dysphoria</i>, the medical condition defining the aversion to one's assigned gender, and the alignment with their true gender causes euphoria, or a strong attraction and affirmation of their gender. The American Psychiatric Association classifies gender dysphoria as a mental disorder and states, “The gender conflict affects people in different ways … they may often experience significant distress and/or problems functioning associated with this conflict between the way they feel and think of themselves (referred to as experienced or expressed gender) and their physical or assigned gender.” <i>People can’t control their gender. We need to stop acting like they can and instead start accepting who they are.</i>
